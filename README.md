# recursiveQuerySelector
Recursively runs querySelectorAll on embedded WebComponents and returns an array of hits. 
This is not intended to form part of a production app, since to do so defeatsthe concept of WebComponents. However it is incredibly useful as a developer aid, to be run from the console,
as a debugging aid, and also as part of unit and e2e tests.
